#        UniversalSNPsplit 
UniversalSNPsplit is an software as a universal solution to split reads from bam file based on list of SNPs. The splitting is independent of the feature of reads alignment, such as indel, splicing, pair-end. The splitting is aslo independent of library type, for example, RNA-seq, Chip-seq, WGBS and Hi-C. It is most sensitive software so far for the same purpose.

UniversalSNPsplit can also be run in a parallel computing mode. Thus, it is super fast.
