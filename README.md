#        UniversalSNPsplit 
UniversalSNPsplit is an universal solution software to split reads from bam file based on list of SNPs. The splitting is independent of the feature of reads alignment, containning indel, splicing, pair-end. The splitting is aslo independent of library type, such as RNA-seq, Chip-seq, WGBS and Hi-C. It is most sensitive software so far to this purpose.
UniversalSNPsplit can also be run in a parallel computing mode, thus, it is super fast.
