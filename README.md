# UniversalSNPsplit is an universal solutions software to split reads from bam file based on list of SNPs. The splitting is independent of the feature of reads alignment, containning indel, splicing, pair-end. The splitting is aslo independent of library type, such as RNA-seq, Chip-seq, Hi-C, WGBS. 
UniversalSNPsplit can also be run in a parrel computing way, thus, it is super fast.
